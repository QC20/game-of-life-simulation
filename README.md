## Features

- Engage with a dynamic, evolving world through interactive gameplay.
- Experience the magic of cellular automata and emergent behaviors.
- Witness mesmerizing patterns and explore the infinite possibilities of life.
- Enjoy a soothing and immersive visual experience powered by p5.js.

## Gameplay

1. Open the game in the p5.js editor or any other JavaScript development environment.
2. The game will start automatically, presenting you with a grid of cells.
3. Interact with the cells by clicking on them to bring them to life.
4. Observe how the cells evolve and interact with each other based on a set of rules.
5. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the mesmerizing patterns that emerge.

## Rules of Life

The game follows the basic principles of cellular automata. The rules for cell interaction are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Tips

- Experiment with different initial cell configurations to observe various patterns.
- Observe how stable structures, oscillators, and gliders emerge over time.
- Try to create your own unique patterns and see how they evolve.

Enjoy the meditative experience of Life's Journey as you explore the depths of emergent life patterns!
